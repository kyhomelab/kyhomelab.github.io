## About Me:  

Hi there! Thank you for clicking on this post! My name is Kyle, and I wanted to talk a little more about who I am, my passions, and my drives. I have been in a customer service role for 6+ years and started getting more into IT back in 2020 and getting my A+ on June 30, 2021. I've grown up around tech all my life, being designated as the IT guy that family and friends would go to. I absolutely love learning about computers, systems, coding, and anything else I can really get technical with. I remember trying to use Cheat Engine back in the Adventure Quest days. Nowadays, i'm a huge homelab enthusiast, building my own server using Proxmox, destroying our home network and pushing what I can do and learn.

## My Journey:

### At least in the Tech Industry I was able to have a job working at a PC building company for almost a year:
* Started off as a customer service rep for the company. Taking calls, and triaging PC issues from not booting, to boot looping, and everythig in between.
* Because it was a smaller company, within a few months I was able to become the helpdesk supervisor
* I started the knowlegdge base there, establishing processes, consolidating knowledge, and working directly with both Builders and Testers to increase quality control
* I was overseeing a small team of customer service reps, handling escalations and running team meetings to discuss trends and to get ahead of potential problems
* After a few months I became the Hardware/Software Integration and System Administrator
* Being in this role I was able to have more freedom to start implementing changes company wide
* First thing I did was create a Nas Server for files to be shared across departments. There were two iterations I made, the first being a TrueNas Server, and the second being a Windows Server 2022
* This was the first time I was able to get experience using Windows Server, created domains, AD groups, users, password policies, network drives, etc.
* I ran into so many problems getting everything set up, but because of my drive and interest, I was able to get everything set up.
* I pushed for better networking in the building, and was able to get an old Dell managed switch
* The location for the switch was in the testing room, and I helped run ethernet lines throughout the building to about ~20 pcs spread throughout the building
* [I created a script using powershell](https://github.com/kyhomelab/Powershell-Scripts) that would in order: Checking Administrator Privileges,  Setting Wallpaper, Displaying WiFi Password, Opening Disk Management, Windows Activation, Gathering System Information, Formatting, Opening Test Applications, and Exiting after a key input<br>
These are just a few highlights from working there, and I definitley learned a lot, especially when it comes to hardware and my first hands on with server administration and understanding networking

### Currently i'm contracted out to [Venable LLP](https://www.venable.com/) and came on as a Senior Tier 1 analyst:
* Honestly, there is so much that I do here its really hard to talk about `EVERYTHING`
* Having this opportunity though, i've been able to get experience in an Enterprise setting and get a chance to see and use a lot of different applications and how things operate in an IT environment.
* Since I wear many hats, i've been able to use:<br>
*Splunk*<br>
*Okta Verify*<br>
*Cherwell*<br>
*SCCM for remoting in*<br>
*Powershell for pulling Group Memberships*<br>
*Citrix Workspace*<br>
*Cisco Secure Mobility Client (VPN)*<br>
*IManage*<br>
*Citrix Director*<br>
*Network Shares*<br>
*Microsoft Office*<br>
*and many more*<br>
<br>
* I help to train new team members on policies, procedures, SLA, ticketing best practices, escalation procedures, and overall asking for assistance.
* We deal with on average ~250 emails / calls a day and some tickets require several days of troubleshooting due to schedules.

### What Drives Me:
Learning. <br>
On a serious note, I do enjoy learning, problem solving, critical thinking, and bashing my head at a problem until I get it to work.
