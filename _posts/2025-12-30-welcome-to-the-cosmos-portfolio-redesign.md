# Welcome to the Cosmos: A Portfolio Redesign Journey

Hey there! If you've been here before, you might've noticed things look a *little* different. Okay, a lot different. My portfolio went from "basic professional template" to "digital cosmos explorer" and I couldn't be happier about it.

## Out with the Old, In with the Cosmic

Let's be real - my old portfolio was getting stale. It did the job, but it didn't really reflect who I am or how much I've grown. My skills have leveled up significantly over the past year, and my portfolio should show that evolution. Plus, I was starting to feel like I'd built someone else's portfolio, not mine.

So I decided it was time for a complete overhaul. And when I say complete, I mean *complete*. New theme, new colors, new vibe - the whole nine yards.

## Why Space? (Buckle Up, This Gets Nerdy)

Okay, so why did I go full space theme? Three words: **I'm a nerd.**

Growing up, I was *obsessed* with space. Like, Space Camp every summer obsessed. There's something about the vastness of the universe, the mystery of black holes, the beauty of nebulae - it just hits different, you know? I'd spend hours reading about missions to Mars, watching documentaries about the ISS, and dreaming about what's out there beyond our little blue dot.

And then there's the sci-fi angle. I'm a huge Futurama fan (seriously, I've watched the entire series way too many times), and the idea of blending technology with that retro-futuristic space aesthetic just speaks to me. If my portfolio could exist in the Futurama universe, I'd be stoked.

So when it came time to redesign, the space theme was a no-brainer. It's authentic to who I am, it's visually interesting, and honestly? It's just *cool*.

## The Colors: A Cosmic Palette

Let's talk about the color choices because I'm genuinely proud of how this turned out.

**Nebula Purple (#6b4ce6)**: This is the star of the show (pun intended). Purple nebulae are some of the most stunning cosmic phenomena out there, and this shade perfectly captures that mysterious, otherworldly vibe. It's bold without being obnoxious, and it pairs beautifully with darker backgrounds.

**Cosmic Cyan (#00d4ff)**: Think of this as the "electric energy" color. It reminds me of pulsars and ionized gas clouds - those bright, energetic bursts you see in space photography. I use it for accents, glows, and hover effects to give things that sci-fi tech feel.

**Supernova Pink (#ff006e)**: This one's for the high-energy moments. Supernovae are these massive stellar explosions that release insane amounts of energy, and this pink captures that intensity. I use it sparingly for important CTAs and highlights.

The whole palette works together to create this "floating through a nebula" aesthetic, which is exactly what I was going for. Dark backgrounds (because space is dark, duh), with vibrant cosmic colors popping through. Glass-morphism effects, subtle glows, animated starfields - the whole package.

## A Bit About Me Beyond Cybersecurity

So while we're here, let me take a second to talk about who I am beyond the resume and certifications.

**Gaming**: I'm a gamer at heart. Whether it's diving into a story-driven RPG, strategizing in a tactical shooter, or just goofing around in a sandbox game, gaming is my go-to way to unwind. It's also where I first got interested in tech - I wanted to understand how these virtual worlds worked under the hood.

**Home Lab Tinkering**: If you've poked around my projects, you've seen I have a bit of a home lab obsession. There's something deeply satisfying about spinning up a new VM, configuring security tools, breaking things, and then fixing them. It's like a digital playground where I can experiment without consequences. Plus, it's how I stay sharp and learn new tech.

**Outdoors**: I'm not *always* behind a screen. I love getting outside - hiking, camping, just being in nature. There's a weird parallel between exploring the outdoors and exploring cybersecurity: both require curiosity, patience, and a willingness to get a little lost before you find your way.

**Always Learning**: This is probably the most "me" thing about me. I'm constantly reading, tinkering, taking courses, trying new things. Whether it's a new certification, a new programming language, or just a deep dive into a topic I find interesting, I'm always chasing that next "aha!" moment.

## What's Next?

Now that the redesign is live, I'm planning to actually *use* this blog more. I've got some project write-ups in the pipeline, some tutorials I want to share, and maybe some more personal posts like this one.

I'm also working on a few new home lab projects that I'm excited to document - including a hybrid Azure honeypot that's collecting some wild threat intelligence data. Stay tuned for that.

And who knows? Maybe I'll keep tweaking the design. Add some shooting stars, maybe a parallax effect or two. The beauty of owning your own site is you can keep making it yours.

## Closing Thoughts

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I know a blog post about a portfolio redesign isn't exactly edge-of-your-seat content, but I wanted to share the *why* behind the new look. This site isn't just a resume - it's a reflection of who I am, what I care about, and where I'm headed.

So yeah, welcome to the cosmos. Feel free to poke around, check out the projects, read some posts, and reach out if you want to chat about cybersecurity, space, gaming, or literally anything else.

And remember: in the words of the great Professor Farnsworth, "Good news, everyone!" - my portfolio doesn't look boring anymore.

**Stay curious,**
Kyle
